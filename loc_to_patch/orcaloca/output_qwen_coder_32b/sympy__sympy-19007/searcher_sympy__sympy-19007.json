    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe BlockMatrix class does not have an explicitly defined __getitem__ method, which might be causing the issue. The _entry method is used for indexing, but we need to ensure that the correct block is accessed when using C[i, 0]. The __getitem__ method might be inherited from the MatrixExpr class, which uses _entry for indexing.\n</Observation>",
