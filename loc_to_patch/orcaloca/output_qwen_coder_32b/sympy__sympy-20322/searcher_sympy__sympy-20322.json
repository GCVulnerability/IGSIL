    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the main function being investigated. The signsimp, bottom_up, and done functions/methods are also relevant. The sympify function needs to be investigated in the broader codebase. The kernS function in sympy/core/sympify.py is also relevant. The ceiling function in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py is relevant. The DiracDelta simplify method in sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py does not modify the expression. The BooleanAtom simplify method in sympy/logic/boolalg.py does not modify the expression. The _eval_number method in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py is relevant. The __lt__ method in sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py is relevant.\n</Observation>",
