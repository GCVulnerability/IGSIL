    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe doit method in the Integral class is complex and handles various integration scenarios. The doit methods in BaseScalarField, Atom, and QExpr simply return self, which is unlikely to be the source of the issue. The _ callable in the Integrals module does not seem directly related to the integration process. Further investigation into the CrossProduct class and its doit method is needed.\n</Observation>",
