    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe _print_Sum method in LatexPrinter handles summation expressions and includes handling for subscripts. The _print_Mul method handles multiplication expressions but does not directly address subscript issues. The _print_Symbol and _deal_with_super_sub methods are also potential candidates for handling subscript formatting issues.\n</Observation>",
