    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to how ColumnTransformer handles transformers with no features when the output is set to 'pandas'. The _hstack method is responsible for stacking the results horizontally, and the _iter method is used to iterate over the transformers. The _iter method skips transformers with no features, which causes issues in _hstack when trying to concatenate the results.\n</Observation>",
