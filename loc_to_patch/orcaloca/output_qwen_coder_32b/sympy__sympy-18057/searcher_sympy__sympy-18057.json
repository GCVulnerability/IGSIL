    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe __eq__ method in sympy/core/expr.py uses sympify, which can lead to eval being used on the repr of an object, causing an AttributeError. The sympify function in sympy/core/sympify.py uses eval on the string representation of an object, which can lead to an AttributeError. The parse_expr function in sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py also uses eval_expr, which is likely where the eval call is happening.\n</Observation>",
