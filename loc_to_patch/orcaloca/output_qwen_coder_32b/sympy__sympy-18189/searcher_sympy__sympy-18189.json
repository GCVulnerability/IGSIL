    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe diophantine function handles permutations differently based on the order of symbols provided. The issue might be related to how the solutions are merged and permuted. The signed_permutations function generates permutations with different signs, but the problem might be in how these permutations are integrated back into the final solution set.\n</Observation>",
