    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe __init__ method of ResolverMatch does not handle functools.partial objects, and the __repr__ method uses self._func_path directly, which would show 'functools.partial' for partial functions. The lookup_str method in URLPattern handles functools.partial by unwrapping it, which could be a useful reference.\n</Observation>",
