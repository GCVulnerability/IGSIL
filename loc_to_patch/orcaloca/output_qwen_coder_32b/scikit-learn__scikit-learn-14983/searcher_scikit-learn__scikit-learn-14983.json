    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold classes inherit from _RepeatedSplits, which in turn inherits from BaseCrossValidator. The BaseCrossValidator class has a __repr__ method that uses _build_repr(self). However, the _RepeatedSplits class does not override the __repr__ method, so it uses the default implementation from BaseCrossValidator. This leads to the default object representation being returned for RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold.\n</Observation>",
