    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe 'Line3D' class is found in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py'. The '_verts3d' attribute is initialized in the '__init__' method and updated in 'set_data_3d' and 'set_3d_properties' methods. The 'line_2d_to_3d' function converts a 2D line to 3D by setting the class to 'Line3D' and calling 'set_3d_properties'. The issue might be related to how 'Line3D' objects are being created and updated in the provided code.\n</Observation>",
