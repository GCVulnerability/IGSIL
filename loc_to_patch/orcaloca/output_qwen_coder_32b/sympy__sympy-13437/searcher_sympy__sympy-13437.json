    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe 'doit' method in 'sympy/series/limits.py' uses 'gruntz' and 'heuristics' to evaluate limits. The 'gruntz' function in 'sympy/series/gruntz.py' computes limits using the Gruntz algorithm. The 'heuristics' function in 'sympy/series/limits.py' is used as a fallback when 'gruntz' fails. The 'limitinf' function is called within 'gruntz' to compute limits as z approaches infinity. The 'mrv' function is also called within 'gruntz' to find the most rapidly varying subexpressions.\n</Observation>",
