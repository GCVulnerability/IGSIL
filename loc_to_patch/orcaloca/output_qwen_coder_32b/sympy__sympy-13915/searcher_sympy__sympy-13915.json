    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe subs method in sympy/core/basic.py does not handle cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions directly. The _subs method handles substitutions and falls back to a fallback method if no special replacement is made. The fallback method tries to replace old with new in any of self's arguments. Other subs methods in different classes (FracElement, PolyElement, MatrixOperations, Dyadic, Vector) might also be involved.\n</Observation>",
