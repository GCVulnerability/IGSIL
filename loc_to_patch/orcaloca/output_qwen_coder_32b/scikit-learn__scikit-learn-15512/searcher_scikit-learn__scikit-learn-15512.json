    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe fit method in the AffinityPropagation class calls the affinity_propagation function. The affinity_propagation function correctly handles non-convergence cases by returning an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for labels. However, the fit method does not update the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes accordingly when the algorithm does not converge.\n</Observation>",
