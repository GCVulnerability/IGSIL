    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe get_order_by method in SQLCompiler handles the ORDER BY clause and might be influenced by the default ordering of the model. The issue might be related to how the default ordering interacts with the specified order_by in the queryset. The order_by method in QuerySet adds ordering to the query. The RelatedPopulator class might be involved in handling related fields and their ordering.\n</Observation>",
