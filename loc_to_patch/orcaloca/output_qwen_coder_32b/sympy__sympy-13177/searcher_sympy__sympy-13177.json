    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe eval method in sympy/core/mod.py does not handle cases where the base is not an integer. The doit method is called within eval and also does not handle non-integer bases. The _eval_is_integer method checks if both arguments are integers but does not address the issue in the context of Mod evaluation.\n</Observation>",
