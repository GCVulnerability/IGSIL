    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to how NaN values are handled in the _convert_dx method and _safe_first_finite function within the Axes class and cbook module. The _safe_first_finite function is supposed to return the first finite value, but it seems to be failing when all values are NaN.\n</Observation>",
