    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to how the Python code printer handles tuples with a single element. The method `doprint` in the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class and the `lambdify` function are involved in this process. The `_recursive_to_string` function and `_convert_python_lists` function might also be relevant.\n</Observation>",
