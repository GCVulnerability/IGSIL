    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe Collector.delete method handles the deletion process and returns the count of deleted objects and the rows count. The QuerySet.delete method uses a Collector instance to perform the deletion and returns the count of deleted objects and the rows count. The issue might be in how the Collector.delete method handles the case where no objects are deleted.\n</Observation>",
