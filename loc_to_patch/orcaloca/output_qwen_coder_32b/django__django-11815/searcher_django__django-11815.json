    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe CharField class in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py seems to be responsible for handling default values in migrations. The get_prep_value method and the deconstruct method are potential places where the bug might be located. The deconstruct method is particularly relevant as it handles how the field is serialized into a migration file.\n</Observation>",
