    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe order_by method in QuerySet adds ordering to the query but does not apply the Meta ordering during initialization. The __init__ method initializes the QuerySet but does not apply the Meta ordering. The _clone method does not handle the Meta ordering either. The _fetch_all method might be involved in fetching the data and applying the ordering. The _get_ordering method in QuerySet might be responsible for applying the Meta ordering from the model.\n</Observation>",
