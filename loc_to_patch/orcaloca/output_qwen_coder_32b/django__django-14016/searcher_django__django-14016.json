    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe _combine method in the Q class uses deepcopy, which might be failing due to non-pickleable objects like dict_keys. The __deepcopy__ method in the Node class also uses deepcopy, but it handles children recursively. The __or__ method in the Q class calls _combine, so both methods are potential bug locations.\n</Observation>",
