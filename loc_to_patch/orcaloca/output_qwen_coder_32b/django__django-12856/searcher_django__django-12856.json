    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe UniqueConstraint class does not check if the fields exist in the model. The constraint_sql and create_sql methods assume the fields exist and attempt to retrieve their columns. We need to find where makemigrations processes UniqueConstraints and compare it with how it handles unique_together.\n</Observation>",
