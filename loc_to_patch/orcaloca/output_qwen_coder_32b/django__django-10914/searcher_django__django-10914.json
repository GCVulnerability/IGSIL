    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe _save method in FileSystemStorage sets file permissions to 0o666 initially and then changes them to self.file_permissions_mode if it is not None. The TemporaryUploadedFile class uses tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile, which sets permissions to 0o600. The FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting is currently None, which might be causing the issue.\n</Observation>",
