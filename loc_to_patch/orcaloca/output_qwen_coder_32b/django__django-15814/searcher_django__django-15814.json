    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error seems to be related to the initialization of RelatedPopulator and the use of only() after select_related(). The suggested fix involves using cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta instead of cur_model._meta. The __iter__ method in ModelIterable and the populate method in RelatedPopulator are potential areas to investigate.\n</Observation>",
