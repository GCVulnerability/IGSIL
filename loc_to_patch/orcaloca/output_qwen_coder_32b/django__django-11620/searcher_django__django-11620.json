    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe RoutePattern class in django/urls/resolvers.py handles the to_python method of converters. The to_python method in IntConverter raises ValueError, not Http404. The get_object_or_404 function raises Http404 if the object does not exist. We need to check how Http404 is handled in the URL resolver and the implementation of other converters.\n</Observation>",
