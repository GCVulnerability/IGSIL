    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe _estimate_mi function compares discrete_features to 'auto' using '==', which will cause issues in future numpy versions if discrete_features is an array or boolean mask. Additionally, the function is not tested with discrete_features values other than 'auto'.\n</Observation>",
