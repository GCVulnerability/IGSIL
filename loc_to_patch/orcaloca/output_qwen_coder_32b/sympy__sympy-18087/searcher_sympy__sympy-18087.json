    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe trigsimp function uses different methods for simplification, including 'matching', 'groebner', 'combined', and 'fu'. The issue might be related to how these methods handle complex trigonometric expressions. The 'matching' method uses the futrig function, and the 'groebner' method uses the trigsimp_groebner function. The _futrig function applies several transformations, including TR1, TR2, TR3, TR2i, TR10, L, TR10i, TR8, TR6, TR15, TR16, TR111, TR5, TRmorrie, TR11, TR14, TR22, and TR12. The TR8 function is particularly relevant as it converts products of cos and/or sin to a sum or difference of cos and/or sin terms.\n</Observation>",
