    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue is that the code printer interprets 'I' as the imaginary unit instead of the identity matrix. The lambdify function uses a printer to convert SymPy expressions to a string representation suitable for numerical evaluation. The _postprocessor function is part of the matrix expression handling and might be involved in how expressions are processed before being passed to the printer.\n</Observation>",
