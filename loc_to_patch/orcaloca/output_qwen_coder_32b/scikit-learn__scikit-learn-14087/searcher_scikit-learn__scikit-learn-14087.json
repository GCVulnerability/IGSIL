    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs in the fit method of LogisticRegressionCV when refit is False. The issue seems to be related to the handling of coefs_paths and best_indices in the case of multi_class being 'ovr'. The _log_reg_scoring_path function is called within fit, and the _logistic_regression_path function is called within _log_reg_scoring_path.\n</Observation>",
