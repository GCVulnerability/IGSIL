    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe Intersection class's __new__ method flattens inputs to merge intersections and iterables, but it does not explicitly handle duplicates. The identity method returns the UniversalSet, which is not relevant to the problem statement. We need to investigate the _contains method to see how it handles the containment of elements in the Intersection set.\n</Observation>",
