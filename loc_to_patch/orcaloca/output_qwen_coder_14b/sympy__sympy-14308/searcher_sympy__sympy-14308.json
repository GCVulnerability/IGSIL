    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that CoordSysCartesian is a deprecated function that redirects to CoordSys3D. We need to investigate the pretty printing methods in CoordSys3D to find the bug. The __str__ method in CoordSys3D simply returns the name of the coordinate system, which may not be sufficient for pretty printing. We need to search for other methods related to pretty printing in CoordSys3D.\n</Observation>",
