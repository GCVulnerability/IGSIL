    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the RequestException class in requests/exceptions.py is a subclass of IOError and includes an __init__ method that initializes with request and response objects. The problem statement suggests that urllib3 exceptions such as DecodeError and TimeoutError are passing through the requests API, which implies that these exceptions might not be properly wrapped by the requests library.\n</Observation>",
