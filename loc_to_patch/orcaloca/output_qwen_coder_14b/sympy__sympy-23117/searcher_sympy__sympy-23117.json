    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs in the creation of an empty Array using sympy.Array([]). The traceback points to the _scan_iterable_shape method in the ndim_array.py file, which seems to be responsible for handling the iterable input and determining its shape. The error message indicates a ValueError due to not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0). This suggests that the method is not handling empty iterables correctly.\n</Observation>",
