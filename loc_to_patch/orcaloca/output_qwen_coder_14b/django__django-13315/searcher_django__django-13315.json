    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe provided search results show the __init__, check, _check_on_delete, _check_unique, formfield, and deconstruct methods of the ForeignKey and OneToOneField classes in django/db/models/fields/related.py. The problem statement suggests that using a Q object as limit_choices_to can result in duplicate options in the form. We need to further investigate the formfield method and related checks to identify potential bug locations.\n</Observation>",
