    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe __add__ method in the Media class simply concatenates the _css_lists and _js_lists from two Media objects. This might not handle the order of JavaScript files correctly, leading to MediaOrderConflictWarnings. We need to investigate the resolve_order method to understand how the order is determined and if there are any issues.\n</Observation>",
