    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe provided code snippets and search results indicate that the issue might be related to how pytest processes markers in newer versions. The `add_marker` method in `nodes.py` seems to handle the addition of markers correctly, but there might be changes in how pytest processes these markers in pytest 6.0.0rc0. We need to investigate further by searching for the class or method that might be handling the marker processing differently in pytest 6.0.0rc0.\n</Observation>",
