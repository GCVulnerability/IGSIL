    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error indicates that the field 'choice' is not found in the model 'Question' or 'QuestionAdmin'. This suggests that the 'list_display' attribute in 'QuestionAdmin' is referencing a field that does not exist in the 'Question' model. We need to search for the 'Question' and 'QuestionAdmin' classes to understand the structure and verify the fields.\n</Observation>",
