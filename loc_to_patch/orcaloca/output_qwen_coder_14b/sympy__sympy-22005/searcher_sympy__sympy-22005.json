    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search for the method 'solve' in the class 'PolySystem' did not yield any results. The provided code snippet and test cases suggest that the function `solve_poly_system` is not handling certain cases correctly, specifically when the system has an infinite number of solutions. The diff shows a change in the `_solve_reduced_system` function to check if the number of generators matches the number of univariate polynomials. However, the test cases in `test_polysys.py` suggest that the function still raises `NotImplementedError` for certain inputs.\n</Observation>",
