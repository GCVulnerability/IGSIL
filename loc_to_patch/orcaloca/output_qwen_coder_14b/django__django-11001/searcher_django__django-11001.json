    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the SQLCompiler is incorrectly removing 'order by' clauses due to a regular expression issue in the get_order_by() method. The issue seems to be related to multiline RawSQL expressions and the way the regular expression handles newlines. The provided search result shows the get_order_by() method in the SQLCompiler class, which includes the problematic line where the regular expression is applied to the SQL query.\n</Observation>",
