    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the FileSystemStorage class has methods related to file permissions and caching. The TemporaryUploadedFile class also has methods related to file handling. The problem statement suggests that the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS might not be consistent, which could be related to the methods in these classes.\n</Observation>",
