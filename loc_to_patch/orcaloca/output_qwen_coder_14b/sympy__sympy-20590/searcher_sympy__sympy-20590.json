    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe '__new__' method in the 'Basic' class does not explicitly define '__slots__'. This could potentially lead to the introduction of '__dict__' in instances of 'Symbol'. We need to investigate the '__getstate__' and '__setstate__' methods to understand how state management is handled and if it contributes to the presence of '__dict__'. Additionally, examining the file contents of 'basic.py' might provide more context on the changes made in version 1.7.\n</Observation>",
