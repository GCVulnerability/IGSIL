    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show that the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class does not have a get_response_async method, which is causing the 'NoneType' object is not callable error. The StaticFilesHandlerMixin class has a _should_handle method, but it does not have a get_response_async method either. The StaticFilesHandler class has a __call__ method that calls the superclass's __call__ method, but it does not have a get_response_async method. The search queue now includes actions to find the get_response_async method, the __init__ method in the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class, and the contents of the handlers.py file.\n</Observation>",
