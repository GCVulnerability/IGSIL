    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show that the sqlmigrate command wraps its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL. The issue seems to be related to the migration executor and the sqlmigrate logic not considering the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature. The search result for the MigrationExecutor class's migrate method shows that it does not consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature. The search result for the Command class's handle method in sqlmigrate.py shows that the output_transaction attribute is set based on the migration.atomic attribute, but it does not consider the connection.features.can_rollback_ddl feature.\n</Observation>",
