    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the DurationField class has methods prepare_value, to_python, and clean. The error messages are defined in the default_error_messages dictionary. The help_text method is not explicitly defined in the class, but it might be inherited from the Field class. We need to further investigate the to_python method and the error messages to identify the bug.\n</Observation>",
