    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the UniqueConstraint class does not perform any checks for the existence of fields. The __init__ method only checks if the fields list is empty and if the condition and deferrable parameters are valid. The constraint_sql method retrieves the column names for the fields but does not verify their existence. The _get_condition_sql method builds the SQL for the condition but does not check the fields. The CheckConstraint class and its methods do not seem to be related to the issue.\n</Observation>",
