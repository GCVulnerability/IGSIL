    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show that the Vector class has several methods, including components, normalize, dot, and pretty_print. The pretty_print method is not found in the Vector class, but it is found in the CoordSys3D class. The pretty_print method in the CoordSys3D class might be responsible for the jumbled output. The search results also show the implementation of the _sympystr method in the VectorAdd and BaseVector classes, which are responsible for the string representation of the vectors. The search results also show the implementation of the __new__ method in the BaseVector and VectorAdd classes, which are responsible for the creation of new instances of these classes. The search results also show the implementation of the _sympyrepr method in the BaseVector class, which is responsible for the representation of the vectors in the SymPy language. The search results also show the implementation of the __iter__ method in the CoordSys3D class, which is responsible for the iteration over the base vectors of the coordinate system. The search results also show the implementation of the _sympystr method in the CoordSys3D class, which is responsible for the string representation of the coordinate system.\n</Observation>",
