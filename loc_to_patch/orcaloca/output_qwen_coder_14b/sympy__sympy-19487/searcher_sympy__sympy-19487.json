    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe current implementation of the `sign` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` does not handle the case when `x` is zero consistently. The problem statement suggests that `sign(0)` should be `nan` to match the behavior of `0 / Abs(0)`. We need to investigate how the `rewrite` method can be used to express `sign` in terms of `Abs` and handle the zero case appropriately.\n</Observation>",
