    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs in the _delete_composed_index method in django/db/backends/base/schema.py. The issue seems to be related to the handling of constraints for index_together and unique_together. The method checks for the number of constraints and raises a ValueError if the number is not equal to 1. This could be due to the presence of both index_together and unique_together constraints on the same fields.\n</Observation>",
