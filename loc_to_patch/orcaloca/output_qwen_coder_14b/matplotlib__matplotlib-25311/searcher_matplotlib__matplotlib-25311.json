    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' class and its methods 'paintEvent' and 'print_figure' are involved in the error. The 'paintEvent' method uses 'QPainter' and 'QImage', which might not be picklable. The 'print_figure' method calls 'super().print_figure' and 'self.draw', which might also be related to the issue.\n</Observation>",
