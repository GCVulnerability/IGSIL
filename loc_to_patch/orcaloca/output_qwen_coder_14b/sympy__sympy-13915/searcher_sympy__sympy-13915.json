    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue might be related to the substitution handling in the sympy library. The _eval_subs method in the Add class seems to be involved in the substitution process. Further investigation into the _addsort and _unevaluated_Add functions is needed to understand how they handle the substitution and potentially identify the bug.\n</Observation>",
