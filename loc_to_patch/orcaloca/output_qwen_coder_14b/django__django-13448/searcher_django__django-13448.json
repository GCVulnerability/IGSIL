    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error message indicates that the relation 'django_admin_log' does not exist during the test setup. This suggests that the test database is not being set up correctly when 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} is used. The search results show the 'setup_databases' method in the 'DiscoverRunner' class, which calls '_setup_databases'. We need to investigate further into the '_setup_databases' function and the 'create_test_db' method in the 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class to understand how the test database is being set up.\n</Observation>",
