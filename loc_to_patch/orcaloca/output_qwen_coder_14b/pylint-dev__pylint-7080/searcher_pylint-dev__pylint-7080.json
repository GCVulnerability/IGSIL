    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search_file_contents API call failed to unpack a NoneType object, indicating that the file 'pyproject.toml' might not exist or is not accessible in the specified directory. The problem statement indicates that the `ignore-paths` configuration in `pyproject.toml` is being ignored when running Pylint with `--recursive=y`. The Pylint output includes files under `src/gen/`, which should be ignored according to the configuration.\n</Observation>",
