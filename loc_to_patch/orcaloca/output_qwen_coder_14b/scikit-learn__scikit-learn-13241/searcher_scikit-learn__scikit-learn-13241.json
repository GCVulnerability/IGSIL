    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the KernelPCA class has methods related to fitting and transforming data. The methods _fit_transform, _fit_inverse_transform, fit_transform, and _fit are involved in the dimension reduction process. The issue with sign inconsistency might be related to these methods or the RBF kernel implementation.\n</Observation>",
