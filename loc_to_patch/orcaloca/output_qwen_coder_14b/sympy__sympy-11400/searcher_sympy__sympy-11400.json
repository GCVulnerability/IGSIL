    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the `sinc` class is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. The class has several methods, including `fdiff`, `eval`, and `_eval_nseries`. The problem statement suggests that the issue might be related to the implementation of the `sinc` function in the codebase.\n</Observation>",
