    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results provide detailed information about the AdminSite class and its methods, including _build_app_dict, register, check, and __init__. The _build_app_dict method is a potential area for modification to make it public. The register method deals with model registration, which might be related to the context of the app_list. The check method runs system checks on all ModelAdmins, and the __init__ method initializes the AdminSite instance.\n</Observation>",
