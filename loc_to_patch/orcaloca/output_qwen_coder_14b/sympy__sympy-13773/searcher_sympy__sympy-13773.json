    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the `@` operator (`__matmul__`) should fail if one argument is not a matrix. Currently, it seems to be copying the behavior of `__mul__`, which allows scalar multiplication. We need to identify where the `__matmul__` method is defined and ensure it checks if both operands are matrices.\n</Observation>",
