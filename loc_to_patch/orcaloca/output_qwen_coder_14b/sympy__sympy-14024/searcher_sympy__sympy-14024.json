    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the 'simplify' method in the 'Expr' class and 'BooleanAtom' class does not provide any simplification logic. The 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' is the primary simplification function. The '_separatevars' and 'separatevars' functions are related to variable separation, which might be relevant to the inconsistency observed. The 'BooleanFunction' class and its methods '_eval_simplify', 'binary_check_and_simplify', and 'to_nnf' are related to boolean logic simplification. The 'And' class and its methods '_new_args_filter' and '_eval_as_set' are related to logical AND operations. The 'AtomicExpr' and 'UnevaluatedExpr' classes and their methods are related to atomic expressions and unevaluated expressions, respectively.\n</Observation>",
