    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe Legend class in lib/matplotlib/legend.py does not have a 'draggable' keyword in its __init__ method. The _set_loc method is responsible for setting the location of the legend, but it does not handle the draggable functionality. We need to investigate further to determine if adding a 'draggable' keyword is feasible and where it should be implemented.\n</Observation>",
