    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the non_form_errors method in the BaseFormSet class is responsible for returning non-form errors in the formset. To add the 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors, we need to modify the rendering logic for these errors. The as_table, as_p, and as_ul methods are responsible for rendering the formset as HTML. We need to modify these methods to add the 'nonform' CSS class to the non-form errors.\n</Observation>",
