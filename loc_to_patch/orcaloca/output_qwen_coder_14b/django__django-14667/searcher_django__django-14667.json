    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe provided search results indicate that the `defer` and `only` methods in the `QuerySet` class handle the addition and removal of deferred fields correctly. However, the issue lies in the interaction between these methods when chaining them. The unexpected behavior is observed when `defer` is called after `only`, leading to incorrect SQL queries being generated. We need to investigate the interaction between these methods to identify the bug.\n</Observation>",
