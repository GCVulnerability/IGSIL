    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the `separability_matrix` function does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels. The code snippets provided show that the separability matrix is expected to be diagonal for simple models but becomes incorrect when models are nested. The `separability_matrix` function calls the `_separable` function, which in turn calls the `_calculate_separability_matrix` method of the `transform` object. The `_separable` function also handles the case where the `transform` is a `CompoundModel` by recursively calling itself on the left and right submodels and then combining the results using the `_operators` dictionary. The `is_separable` function also calls the `_separable` function and then checks if the sum of each row of the resulting matrix is equal to 1, indicating that the output is independent and the result of a separable transform.\n</Observation>",
