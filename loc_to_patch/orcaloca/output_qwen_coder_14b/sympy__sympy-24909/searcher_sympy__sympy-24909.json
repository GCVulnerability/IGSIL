    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe multiplication of the 'milli' prefix with units in SymPy is not behaving as expected. The method '__mul__' in the 'Prefix' class returns 1 when the product of the scale factors is 1. This could be the root cause of the issue. We need to investigate the multiplication method in the 'Unit' class as well to understand how units and prefixes are combined.\n</Observation>",
