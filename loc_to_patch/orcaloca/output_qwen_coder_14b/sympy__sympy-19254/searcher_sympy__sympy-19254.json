    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show the implementations of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` methods in `sympy/polys/factortools.py`. Both methods use the Mignotte bound for univariate and multivariate polynomials, respectively. The problem statement suggests replacing these methods with the Knuth-Cohen bound. To identify potential bug locations, we need to understand the current implementation and compare it with the Knuth-Cohen bound.\n</Observation>",
