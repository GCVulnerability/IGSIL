    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the PrettyPrinter class and its methods are involved in the pretty printing process. The doprint method is where the actual printing logic is implemented. The pretty_print and pretty functions are used to print expressions in a pretty form. The issue might be related to how the PrettyPrinter handles specific expressions like pi**(1/E). We need to investigate the PrettyPrinter class and its methods to find the potential bug.\n</Observation>",
