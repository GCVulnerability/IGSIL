    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to the unpickling process of a matplotlib figure on an M1 Mac. The dpi of the figure is doubling each time it is unpickled, leading to an OverflowError after multiple iterations. The __setstate__ method in the Figure class is responsible for restoring the state of the figure during unpickling. The new_figure_manager_given_figure method is called within this method, which might be causing the dpi to double.\n</Observation>",
