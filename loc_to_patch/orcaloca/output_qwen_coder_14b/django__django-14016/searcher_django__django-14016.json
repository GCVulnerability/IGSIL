    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs when using the | operator on Q objects with a non-pickleable type, such as dict_keys. The issue seems to be related to the pickling process of Q objects. The _combine method in query_utils.py combines Q objects using the _combine method. We need to investigate the _combine method and its interaction with pickling.\n</Observation>",
