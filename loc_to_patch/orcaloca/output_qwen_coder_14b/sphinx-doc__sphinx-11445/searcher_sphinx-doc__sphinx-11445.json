    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe previous search for the method 'visit_title' in the class 'HTMLTranslator' did not find the method. This suggests that the issue might be related to how domain directives are processed in Sphinx. We need to investigate further by searching for the 'process_docstring' method in the 'Domain' class, as this method is responsible for processing docstrings, which might be related to the rendering of headings.\n</Observation>",
