    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe provided search results show the class definition of URLField in django/forms/fields.py. The to_python method includes a split_url function that raises a ValidationError if the URL is malformed. The problem statement indicates that a ValueError is being raised instead of a ValidationError. This suggests that the issue might be related to the URL validation logic in the to_python method or the clean method.\n</Observation>",
