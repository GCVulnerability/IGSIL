    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs when using BoundaryNorm with the format_cursor_data method in matplotlib. The error is raised because BoundaryNorm is not invertible. The inverse method in BoundaryNorm raises a ValueError. The _sanitize_extrema function is related to sanitizing extrema values, but it is not directly related to the error. The format_cursor_data method is part of the artist module, so we need to search for it in the artist.py file.\n</Observation>",
