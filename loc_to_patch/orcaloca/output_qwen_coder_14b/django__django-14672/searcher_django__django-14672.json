    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe 'identity' method in the 'ManyToManyRel' class returns a tuple that includes 'self.through_fields', which is a list. This list is not being made hashable, leading to a TypeError when trying to hash the tuple. The '__init__' method should be checked to ensure that 'make_hashable' is called on 'self.through_fields' if it is a list.\n</Observation>",
