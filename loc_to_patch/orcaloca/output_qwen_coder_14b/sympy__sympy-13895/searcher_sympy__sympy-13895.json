    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the main function responsible for simplifying expressions. The _separatevars function is also relevant as it is used within the simplify function. The BooleanFunction class and its methods are also important to understand how boolean expressions are handled during simplification. The _mag function and AtomicExpr class are less directly related but provide context on how expressions are evaluated and manipulated.\n</Observation>",
