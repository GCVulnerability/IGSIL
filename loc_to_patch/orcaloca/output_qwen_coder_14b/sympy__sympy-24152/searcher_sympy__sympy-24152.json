    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results provide the file skeleton and the relevant class and function signatures for TensorProduct and related functions. The proposed fix involves modifying the _eval_expand_tensorproduct method in the TensorProduct class. We need to search for the specific methods and functions to understand their current implementation and verify the proposed fix.\n</Observation>",
