    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe Collector class's delete method is responsible for the actual deletion process. The inconsistency occurs when there are zero objects to delete, where models with foreign keys return an empty dictionary and 'simple' models return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values. The get_related_populators function is used to collect related objects, but it does not directly handle the deletion process. The Collector class's delete method is responsible for the actual deletion process. We need to investigate the Collector class's delete method to understand why the inconsistency occurs.\n</Observation>",
