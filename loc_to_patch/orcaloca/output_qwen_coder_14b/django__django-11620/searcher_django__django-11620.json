    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show that the StringConverter class in django/urls/converters.py has a to_python method that simply returns the value without raising any exceptions. This could be the reason why raising Http404 does not result in a technical response when DEBUG is True. We need to further investigate how exceptions are handled in the URL resolver.\n</Observation>",
