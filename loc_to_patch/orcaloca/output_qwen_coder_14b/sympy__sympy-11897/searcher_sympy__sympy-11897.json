    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show that the `doprint` method in the `LatexPrinter` class formats the LaTeX output based on the mode settings, while the `doprint` method in the `PrettyPrinter` class simply calls the `_print` method and renders the output. The inconsistency between the two printers could be due to differences in how the `_print` method is implemented in each class. To further investigate, we need to search for the `_print` method in both the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes.\n</Observation>",
