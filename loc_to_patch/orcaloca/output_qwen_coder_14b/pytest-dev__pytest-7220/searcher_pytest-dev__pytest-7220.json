The problem statement indicates that the test file path is displayed incorrectly when the working directory is changed in a fixture. The code snippet provided shows a fixture that changes the working directory to 'ddd' and then reverts it back. The test function 'test_show_wrong_path' fails with an assertion error, and the displayed path in the error message is incorrect.\n</Observation>",
