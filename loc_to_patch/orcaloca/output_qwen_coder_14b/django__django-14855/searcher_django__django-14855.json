    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results show the definition of the AdminForm and Fieldset classes and their methods. The get_admin_url method is not present in the AdminForm class, but it is present in the Fieldset class. The Fieldset class is used in the __iter__ method of the AdminForm class. The __init__ method of the AdminForm class initializes the form, fieldsets, prepopulated_fields, readonly_fields, and model_admin attributes. The __iter__ method of the AdminForm class yields Fieldset objects. The errors, non_field_errors, and media properties of the AdminForm class return the errors, non_field_errors, and media of the form attribute, respectively.\n</Observation>",
