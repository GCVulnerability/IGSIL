    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe KeyError is raised when trying to access a column in the DataFrame that does not exist. This is likely due to the MultiIndex columns not being handled correctly in the pairplot function. The search result for the `map_diag` method in the `PairGrid` class shows that it is responsible for plotting on the diagonal subplots. The issue might be related to how the method handles the data and the columns.\n</Observation>",
