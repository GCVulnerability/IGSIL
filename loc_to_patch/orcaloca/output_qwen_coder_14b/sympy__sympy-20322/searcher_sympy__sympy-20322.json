    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe behavior of sympify and simplify functions with ceiling has changed between sympy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2. The issue seems to be related to the evaluation of the expression when evaluate=False. The simplify method in BooleanAtom class returns self, which might not be the expected behavior. The simplify method in BooleanFunction and Basic classes should be checked for any potential issues.\n</Observation>",
