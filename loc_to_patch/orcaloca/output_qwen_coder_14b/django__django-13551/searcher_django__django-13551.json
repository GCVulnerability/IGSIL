    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the password reset token should be invalidated when the user's email address changes. The fix involves modifying the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address. The current implementation of `_make_hash_value` does not include the user's email address, which could lead to the issue described.\n</Observation>",
