    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder does not consider the db_router's allow_migrate rules. The apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor calls record_migration, which in turn calls ensure_schema. We need to investigate how the db_router's allow_migrate rules are being applied or if they are being applied at all.\n</Observation>",
