    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs in the _setup_scales method of the Plotter class in the seaborn/_core/plot.py file. The issue seems to be related to the handling of boolean data in the color mapping. The _setup method in the ContinuousBase class in the seaborn/_core/scales.py file also has a potential issue with boolean data handling.\n</Observation>",
