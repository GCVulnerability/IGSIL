    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search for the method 'doit' in the class 'Matrix' did not yield any results. This suggests that the method 'doit' might not be directly responsible for the issue. We need to investigate further by searching for the 'sum' method in the 'Matrix' class to understand how the summation of matrix elements is handled.\n</Observation>",
