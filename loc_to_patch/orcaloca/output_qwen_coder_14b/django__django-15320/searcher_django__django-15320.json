    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe Subquery.as_sql() method is generating invalid SQL by removing the first and last symbols. The issue might be related to how the subquery is being constructed or modified within the as_sql method. The SQLiteNumericMixin class's as_sqlite method is casting expressions with output_field=DecimalField() to numeric, but it's not directly related to the Subquery issue.\n</Observation>",
