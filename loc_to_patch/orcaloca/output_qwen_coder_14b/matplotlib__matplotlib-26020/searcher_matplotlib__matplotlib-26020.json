    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs in the method _tick_only when trying to access keys from the axis attribute. The issue seems to be related to the difference in behavior of axis attribute for mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes and other axes instances like GeoAxes where axis is only a callable. Further investigation is needed to understand the behavior of the axis attribute for GeoAxes and how it can be accessed correctly.\n</Observation>",
