    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the function _estimate_mi has a comparison between a string ('auto') and an array, which will cause an error in future versions of numpy. It also suggests that the function is never tested with discrete features other than 'auto'. The search results show the code snippets of the functions _estimate_mi, _compute_mi_cc, and _compute_mi_cd. The comparison between 'auto' and discrete_features in _estimate_mi is the potential bug location.\n</Observation>",
