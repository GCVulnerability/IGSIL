    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue lies in the handling of the returning_fields in the bulk_create method, specifically in the _batched_insert method. The issue might be related to the removal of returning_fields in certain cases when using update_conflicts. The ModelIterable and RawModelIterable classes and their __iter__ methods are also relevant to the query execution process.\n</Observation>",
