    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem is related to the rendering of SeqFormula objects in LaTeX. The _print_SeqFormula method in LatexPrinter class is responsible for printing the SeqFormula object, and it uses backslash-escaped brackets, which is causing the rendering issue. We need to check the surrounding code to see if there are any other methods or classes that might be involved in the rendering process.\n</Observation>",
