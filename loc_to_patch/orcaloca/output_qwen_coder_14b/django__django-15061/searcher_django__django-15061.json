    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe 'id_for_label' method in the MultiWidget class appends '_0' to the id, which is not desired according to the problem statement. The 'get_context' method in the MultipleHiddenInput class also appends an index to the id. We need to search for the 'id_for_label' method in the MultiWidget class to understand its implementation and potential issues.\n</Observation>",
