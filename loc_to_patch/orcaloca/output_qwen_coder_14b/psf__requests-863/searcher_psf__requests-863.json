    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the Request class's .register_hook() method does not handle lists of hook functions correctly. The issue seems to be in the Request.__init__() method where the hooks parameter is parsed. The search results show the content of the Request.__init__() and _build_response() methods, but do not provide information about the .register_hook() method.\n</Observation>",
