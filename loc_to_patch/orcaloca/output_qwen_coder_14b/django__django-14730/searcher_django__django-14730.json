    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe '__init__' method of the ManyToManyField class is the most relevant for checking the related_name and symmetrical attributes. The 'check' method calls other check methods, including '_check_unique'. The '_check_unique' method checks if the field is unique, which is not applicable to ManyToManyFields. The 'resolve_relation' function transforms the relation into a model or fully-qualified model string. The 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function creates the intermediary model for ManyToManyFields.\n</Observation>",
