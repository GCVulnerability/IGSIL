    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search results indicate that the 'Message' class in 'django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py' has methods '__init__', '_prepare', and '__eq__'. The '_prepare' method converts 'extra_tags' to a string if it is not None. The '__init__' method initializes 'extra_tags' with a default value of None. The '__eq__' method compares the 'level' and 'message' attributes of two 'Message' objects. The 'MessageEncoder' and 'MessageDecoder' classes in 'django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py' have methods 'encode' and 'decode' respectively. The 'encode' method serializes a 'Message' object, and the 'decode' method deserializes a serialized 'Message' object. The problem statement indicates that an empty string is being incorrectly converted to None during the serialization and deserialization process. The potential bug locations are the 'encode' and 'decode' methods in the 'MessageEncoder' and 'MessageDecoder' classes respectively.\n</Observation>",
