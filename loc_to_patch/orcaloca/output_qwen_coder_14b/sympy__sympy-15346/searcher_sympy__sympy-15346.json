    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to the simplification of trigonometric expressions involving Rational numbers. The simplify() method works correctly for symbolic expressions but not for Rational numbers in trigonometric functions. The search results show that the TrigonometricFunction class has methods for evaluating whether the function is rational or algebraic, and for expanding complex expressions. The _eval_expand_complex method is responsible for expanding complex expressions, and the _eval_is_rational and _eval_is_algebraic methods are responsible for evaluating whether the function is rational or algebraic, respectively. The _peeloff_pi method is also related to trigonometric functions and may be involved in the simplification process.\n</Observation>",
