    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe search for 'get_FOO_display' method in the 'Model' class did not yield any results. This suggests that the method might be dynamically generated or handled differently in Django 2.2+. We need to investigate further by searching for related classes and methods that might be involved in the generation of 'get_FOO_display'.\n</Observation>",
