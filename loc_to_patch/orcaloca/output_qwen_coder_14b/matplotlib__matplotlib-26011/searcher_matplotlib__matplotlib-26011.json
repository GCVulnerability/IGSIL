    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe problem statement indicates that the 'xlim_changed' callback is not being emitted when an axis is shared with another via 'sharex'. The issue seems to be related to the 'set_xlim' method in 'matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py', where 'emit=False' is used when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes.\n</Observation>",
