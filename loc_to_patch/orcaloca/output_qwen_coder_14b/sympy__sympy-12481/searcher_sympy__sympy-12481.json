    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe provided search results for the `__new__`, `_af_new`, `commutes_with`, `_af_rmul`, and `_af_parity` methods in the `Permutation` class do not provide any direct information about the handling of non-disjoint cycles. The `__new__` method raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, while the `commutes_with` method checks if two permutations commute. To further investigate the issue, we need to search for the `_af_new` method, which is referenced in the `__new__` method, and also search for the file contents to understand the overall structure and context of the `permutations.py` file.\n</Observation>",
