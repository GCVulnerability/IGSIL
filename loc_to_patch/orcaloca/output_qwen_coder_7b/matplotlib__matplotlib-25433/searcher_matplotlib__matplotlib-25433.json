    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe disconnect_events method in AxesWidget is responsible for disconnecting all events created by the widget. The connect_event method is used to connect a callback function with an event. The issue might be related to the interaction between these two methods or the handling of events in the on_changed callback of the RangeSlider.\n</Observation>",
