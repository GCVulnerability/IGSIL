    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe error occurs during text rendering in the PostScript backend. The `annotate` method in `_axes.py` is called by the `savefig` method in `figure.py`, which in turn calls `print_figure` in `backend_bases.py`. The `_print_ps` and `_print_figure` methods in `backend_ps.py` handle the actual rendering. The issue seems to be related to how the text is processed or rendered in the PostScript backend.\n</Observation>",
