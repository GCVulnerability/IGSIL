    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue seems to be related to the conversion of the method from binary to string in the requests library. The problematic line is `method = builtin_str(method)`. This conversion might be causing the method to be treated as a binary string, leading to a 404 error when requests tries to use it.\n</Observation>",
