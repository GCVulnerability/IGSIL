    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue occurs in nested CompoundModels when computing separability_matrix, particularly in the _separable function which uses _operators (specifically _cstack for '&' operation). The _cstack operator might be incorrectly handling nested cases by not properly propagating separability information.\n</Observation>",
