    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nWe've examined the BaseConstraint class and its validate method which raises NotImplementedError. The problem involves customizing ValidationError's code attribute in BaseConstraint.validate. We've also examined the ValidationError.__init__ method which shows how the code parameter is handled. Now we need to look at the subclasses of BaseConstraint to see how they implement validate and raise ValidationError.\n</Observation>",
