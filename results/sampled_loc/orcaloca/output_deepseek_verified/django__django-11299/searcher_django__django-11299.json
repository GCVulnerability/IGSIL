    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue involves SQL generation with OR operators in CheckConstraint, particularly in the WhereNode.as_sql method. The problem appears when combining OR and AND clauses, where field names are incorrectly qualified with table names in OR clauses. The relabel_aliases and relabeled_clone methods in WhereNode might be involved in the incorrect field name qualification.\n</Observation>",
