    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue involves lambdify function not properly handling rational numbers with mpmath module. We've found the main lambdify implementation in sympy/utilities/lambdify.py and an experimental version in sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py. The problem appears to be in the main implementation where rational numbers aren't properly evaluated with mpmath.\n</Observation>",
