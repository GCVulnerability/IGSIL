    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue occurs when printing symbols ending with numbers in MathML presentation format. The bug likely lies in MathMLPresentationPrinter's _print_Symbol method, particularly in how it handles symbol names with numbers. The method splits the symbol name into name, supers, and subs components, but may not properly handle numeric suffixes.\n</Observation>",
