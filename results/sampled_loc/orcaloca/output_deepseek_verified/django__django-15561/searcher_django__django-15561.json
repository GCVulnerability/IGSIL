    "conclusion": "<Observation>\nThe issue involves SQLite's handling of AlterField operations when choices are modified. The DatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_field method in sqlite3/schema.py shows SQLite-specific handling but doesn't appear to check for choices-only changes. The _field_should_be_altered method in BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor doesn't consider choices as a non-database attribute.\n</Observation>",
